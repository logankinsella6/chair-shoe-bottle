Method                  ArrayList Runtime    LinkedList Runtime  Explanation
add(T element)          O(1)                O(1) or O(n)        ArrayList has constant-time add due to direct indexing. LinkedList has constant-time add at the end but may be O(n) when adding at a specific index due to traversal.
getMax()                O(n)                O(n)                Both implementations require traversal to find the maximum element, resulting in linear time complexity.
removeDuplicates()      O(n^2)              O(n^2)              Both implementations require nested loops to compare and remove duplicates, resulting in quadratic time complexity.
reverse()               O(n)                O(n)                Both implementations traverse the list once to reverse it, resulting in linear time complexity.
